How To Run

Option 1: 
Open folder containing project files. 
Open main.html in a web browser. 
Double clicking the main.html file should open it on your default browser.
Or using Visual Studio Code, right click inside the main.html file and click the option that says “Open In Default Browser”.

Option 2: Run Web-Server (requires Node.js)
Ensure web-server file (backend.js) is located in the same folder as all website files.
Install node.js (v14.18.1 or later).
If using Windows, open the command prompt (cmd.exe).
Navigate to the directory containing the web server and website files.
Run the command “node backend.js”.
Step 3 can be repeated with the terminal on a Mac or Linux machine but this has only been tested for Windows.
Leave backend.js running and open a web browser.
Navigate to your device's localhost: 8080.
The address can be changed in the backend.js file to whatever the user wants, but defaults to localhost:8080.
